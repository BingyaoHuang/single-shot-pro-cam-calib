A Fast and Flexible Projector-Camera Calibration System
===

## Introduction
A fast and flexible projector-camera calibration system that is single-shot-per-pose and deals with imperfect planarity of the calibration target. 

Highlights:
* The system explicitly deals with the noise due to imperfect planarity with a novel **bundle adjustment** solution. 
* Our calibration system applies **structured light (SL) pattern keypoints** rather than checkerboard corners. This strategy boosts both the number of keypoints and their spatial distribution, and hence improves calibration robustness.
* Our system requires **only a single shot per pose**, making it practically convenient in many applications.
* A practical **open source projector-camera calibration software** with GUI is provided to benefit the society.

For more info please refer to our [journal paper][8] and [conference paper][1].
* To reproduce [journal paper][8] results please refer to [tase20][9] branch.
* To reproduce [conference paper][1] results please refer to [ismar18][5] branch.

## Updates:
* **05/30/2021: Updated to MATLAB 2021a with new App Designer features. Older versions may have incompatibility issues**. 
* **06/03/2020: [Journal paper][8] accepted**. 
* **04/02/2020: Windows 64-bit executable released, no need to install MATLAB or OpenCV**. See [Windows 64-bit executable](#windows-64-bit-executable-matlab-and-opencv-not-required) below.


## Usage

#### Build from source
1. Install MATLAB 2021a.
2. Install [mexOpenCV v3.3.0][2]
3. Clone this repo and run `calibApp.mlapp` to start the App.

#### Windows 64-bit executable (MATLAB and OpenCV not required)
1. Install [MATLAB Runtime 2021a for Windows 64-bit](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html).
2. Download and extract [ProCamCalib_v0.2.zip](https://github.com/BingyaoHuang/single-shot-pro-cam-calib/releases/download/v0.2/ProCamCalib_v0.2.zip).
3. Run `ProCamCalib.exe`.

## Tutorial
1. Watch a short video tutorial [here][6].
2. Note our method works best for camera resolution <=640x480 and projector resolution <=1920x1080. You can resize the camera image to wdith=640 for the best quality and speed. **If you want to use other resolutions please refer to this [issue](https://github.com/BingyaoHuang/single-shot-pro-cam-calib/issues/10).**

## Calibration

![calib](doc/capture.png)

1. Print a checkerboard pattern and glue it to a white board. Make sure the checkerboard pattern is at the center of the white board and its width/height is around **1/3** of the white board's width/height.
2. Place the white board (with checkerboard glued to it) in front of camera and projector.
3. Run `calibApp.mlapp` (or `ProCamCalib.exe`) to start the App.
4. In the App (see screenshot above), select the projector screen in the top-left `Projector Control` panel dropdown, then click `Preview` on the right of the dropdown to preview the projected structured light pattern.
5. Then select the camera in the top-right `Camera Control` panel, click `Preview` button to start camera review, make sure the white board is in both the camera's and the projector's FOV, i.e, the color grid covers the entire white board and the camera has a full view of the white board.
6. Adjust the projector color grid brightness using the `Projector Brightness` slider and camera parameters using the sliders in `Camera Control` panel. Make sure the color grid is not underexposed or overexposed.
7. Start to capture the images as shown in the gif below. The checkerboard and color grid images will be saved as `lightGrid[i].png` and `colorGrid[i].png`, where `i` is the ith position, e.g.,  `colorGrid01.png` is the color grid image at the 1st position. Although **at least three poses** are sufficient we highly recommend taking more, refer to [Bouguet][7] for a good example.
8. Once sufficient images are captured, click `Calibration` tab on top and select the sets you want to use for calibration, then type the printed checkerboard square size in the text box below `Calibrate` button. Finally click `Calibrate` button.

## 3D reconstruction
1. Note that we use a sparse color grid, thus the reconstructed point cloud is sparse. To obtain a dense point cloud we reconstruct both the grid nodes and edges, then interpolate it to a dense point cloud.
2. Click `Calibration` tab and load a calibration yml file by clicking `Load Calibration`, then select a set in the `Images` list and click `Reconstruct`.
3. You can choose to use `Existing Mask` (saved under data folder) or draw your own object mask.
4. `Use Edges` toggles color grid edge reconstruction.

* 3D alignment error:
    
    After we calibrate the camera-projector pair, we reconstruct a point cloud using [2D structured light point pairs](https://github.com/BingyaoHuang/single-shot-pro-cam-calib/tree/ismar18/data/calibration-11-13-17/MT/Set10.yml) and [calibration data](https://github.com/BingyaoHuang/single-shot-pro-cam-calib/tree/ismar18/data/calibration-11-13-17/results). To calculate reconstruction accuracy, we also capture the [ground truth point cloud](https://github.com/BingyaoHuang/single-shot-pro-cam-calib/tree/ismar18/data/calibration-11-13-17/recon-10.ply) using an Intel RealSense F200 RGBD camera. The point cloud 3D alignment error (Euclidean distance) between the reconstructed point cloud and the ground truth point cloud are given by:
